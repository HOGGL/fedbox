#+TITLE: FedBox: Turnkey Federated Social Networks

* Build Instructions
** Preparing Sources
   First clone the Buildroot source and this repository:
   #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot.git
     cd buildroot
     git checkout -b stable 2021.08.2

     cd ..
     git clone https://github.com/HOGGL/fedbox-external.git
   #+end_src
  
   Next find the defconfig for your single board computer in
   =buildroot/configs= and build the system image. The following
   example will build an image to be used by Qemu. This is useful for
   testing purposes. For details on running the image see
   =board/qemu/arm-vexpress/readme.txt= under the Buildroot tree.
   #+begin_src sh
     cd fedbox-external
     make -C ../buildroot BR2_EXTERNAL=$PWD O=$PWD/output \
	  qemu_arm_vexpress_defconfig
   #+end_src
